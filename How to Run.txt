Step 1_v2: Running the Quarkus Server

Open a terminal window.

Navigate to the directory where the Quarkus server project is located.

You should see the Angular app's interface.
The app fetches data from the Quarkus server and displays it on the page.

Now just input a int value for N and press the calculate button and the result of it will appear in the "Result:" section.
